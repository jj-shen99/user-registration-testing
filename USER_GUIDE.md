- **Slowest Test**: May include setup time (normal for browser tests)
- **Average**: Overall system performance indicator

### JSON Report Structure
Reports are saved in `sample_analysis_results/`:

```json
{
  "test_execution": {
    "timestamp": "2025-08-24T15:11:30",
    "total_tests": 8,
    "passed": 8,
    "pass_rate": 100.0
  },
  "test_results": [...]
}
```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Running Specific Test Categories

#### Run Only Security Tests
```bash
# Modify standalone_test_runner.py to run specific categories
python3 -c "
from standalone_test_runner import StandaloneTestRunner
runner = StandaloneTestRunner()
runner.setup_driver() if hasattr(runner, 'setup_driver') else None
runner.run_security_tests()
runner.generate_summary_report()
"
```

### Custom Test Configuration

#### Modify Test Data
Edit `selenium_config.py` to customize:
```python
# Custom test data
VALID_TEST_DATA_SET = [
    {
        "username": "your_test_user",
        "email": "your_test@example.com",
        "password": "YourTestPass123!",
        "expected_result": "success"
    }
]
```

#### Adjust Timeouts
```python
# In selenium_config.py
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 30  # Increase for slower systems
IMPLICIT_WAIT = 15    # Adjust WebDriver wait time
```

### Running Tests Against Different URLs

#### HTTP Simulation Tests
```bash
# Edit simulated_registration_test.py
# Change BASE_URL = "http://your-test-site.com"
python3 simulated_registration_test.py
```

#### Selenium Tests
```bash
# Edit selenium_standalone_test.py
# Change self.base_url = "http://your-test-site.com"
python3 selenium_standalone_test.py
```

### Batch Test Execution
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create run_all_tests.sh

echo "Running all test modes..."

echo "1. Demo Tests"
python3 drivers/test_demo.py

echo "2. Comprehensive Tests"
python3 drivers/standalone_test_runner.py

echo "3. HTTP Simulation"
python3 drivers/simulated_registration_test.py

echo "4. Selenium Tests"
python3 drivers/selenium_standalone_test.py

echo "All tests completed!"
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "No module named 'pytest'"
**Solution:**
```bash
pip3 install pytest
# or
pip3 install -r drivers/requirements.txt
```

#### Issue: "Chrome WebDriver not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
# The webdriver-manager should handle this automatically
pip3 install webdriver-manager
# or manually download ChromeDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
```

#### Issue: "Address already in use" (Port 5003)
**Solution:**
```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 5003
lsof -i :5003
kill <PID>

# Or use a different port in your test configuration
```

#### Issue: Tests run but no browser appears
**Solution:**
This is normal for headless mode. To see the browser:
```python
# In selenium_standalone_test.py, change:
runner = SeleniumTestRunner(headless=False)
```

#### Issue: Slow test execution
**Solutions:**
- Check internet connection
- Reduce timeout values
- Run tests in headless mode
- Close other applications

#### Issue: Permission denied errors
**Solution:**
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x drivers/*.py

# Or run with python3 explicitly
python3 drivers/test_name.py
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Faster Execution:
1. **Use headless mode** (default in standalone tests)
2. **Reduce wait times** in configuration
3. **Run specific test categories** instead of full suite
4. **Close unnecessary applications**

#### For Better Reliability:
1. **Increase timeout values** for slow networks
2. **Add retry logic** for flaky tests
3. **Use stable test data**
4. **Ensure clean test environment**

## ✅ Best Practices

### Before Running Tests
1. **Close unnecessary browser tabs** (for Selenium tests)
2. **Ensure stable internet connection**
3. **Check available disk space** (for reports)
4. **Verify target URLs are accessible**

### During Test Development
1. **Start with demo mode** to understand structure
2. **Use descriptive test names** following REG_XXX pattern
3. **Include comprehensive docstrings**
4. **Test both positive and negative scenarios**

### After Test Execution
1. **Review JSON reports** for detailed analysis
2. **Check performance metrics** for regressions
3. **Archive test results** for historical comparison
4. **Update test cases** based on findings

### Test Data Management
1. **Use unique identifiers** (timestamps) for test data
2. **Clean up test data** after execution
3. **Avoid hardcoded values** in production tests
4. **Maintain separate test environments**
